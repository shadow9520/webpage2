      <!--A littlebit about my life-->
    <br>
    <br>
      <center><p1>This is a little bit about me. Hello my name is Benjamin Watts/AKA Shadowfang95 or shadowWing27. I was born in Tucson Arizona. I moved to Alabama when I was too young to remember.</p1>
    <br>
    <br>
      <p1> I jumped around from house to house when I was growing up. This was because I was in foster care when I was 6 years old. I jumped from house to house until I was 10. I was adopted by the Watts family and  even though I will never admit it it to them, it was the best thing that happend to me. </p1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p1> I will admit I give them a hard time a lot and sometimes they will give me a hard time too but at the end of the day I know that we all love each other. </p1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p1>My biological family is some what around. By that I mean they come and visit every now and then. Esspecially my Nana. Who visits and lets me visit on vacations and holidays. My biological parants are gone and out of the picture because my biomom is dead and my bio dad well I have no idea who or were he is. </p1>
  <br>
  <br>
    <p1>I am a writer and a programmer now. I am curently on my 4th book and I haven't got them published yet. Maybe I never will but I don't know yet until I read them from a readers perspective. I hope you are enjoying this website. I put a lot of time and energy into this.</p1>
